# The well known Snake game

As a side project, during my studies in Hive Helsinki, I made this small snake game, as a practice in Python.
The game is based on the famous Nokia snake game. You collect food, and each time the snake become one square longer.
It also has a relatively fast speed, so it's become harder to collect food as the snake growing
and the space gets smaller.
If the snake turns into itself or hit the wall (windows edge) the game is over.
With arrows can control the snake where to go.

It's a good and fun small game where with your friends can compete who can reach higher scores.

Just clone the repository and run the code.

Have fun!
